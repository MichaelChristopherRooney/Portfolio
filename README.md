This repository lists the work I am most proud of. 

# Scylla [(link)](https://github.com/MikeyRooney/Scylla)

Scylla is a work in progress Xbox emulator, intended to allow Xbox games to be played on a PC.

It is early in development but has one notable feature already: it can perform ahead of time translation of x86 instructions to x64 instructions. This allows Xbox games to be run in 64 bit mode which solves many issues encountered when emulating Xbox games.

# MSc Collision Project [(link)](https://github.com/MikeyRooney/CollisionProject)

This was my project for my MSc in High Performace Computing. 

The purpose of this project was to investigate ways of speeding up variable time step collision detection. 

By using domain decomposition to reduce the workload and MPI to distribute the work over many cores a total speedup of 25'000x was achieved using 64 cores.

# High Performance Computing Software assignments [(link)](https://github.com/MikeyRooney/MA5611)

Assignments for a module in my MSc in High Performace Computing degree.

These assignments covered topics such as MPI, pthreads, OpenMP, genetic algorithms and solvers for the travelling salesman problem.

# CUDA assignments  [(link)](https://github.com/MikeyRooney/MA5615)

Assignments for a module in my MSc in High Performace Computing degree.

These assignments covered CUDA topics such as determining the optimal grid configuration, minimising slow memory accesses and using multiple CUDA devices at once.

# Optimised Matrix Multiplication [(link)](https://github.com/MikeyRooney/Optimised-Matrix-Multiplication)

An investigation into how optimising cache usage, unrolling loops and using OpenMP can speedup matrix multiplication.

On a 4 core machine a total speedup of 11x was achieved, while on a 64 core server a speedup of 137x was achieved.
